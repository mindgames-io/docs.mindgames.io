# Phase 2 - Press Play

This marks the beginning of the **MIND Games Universe** gaming experience. The [**Arena** ](../learn/game-basics/arena/)first opens its gates to the public. Alongside this, a new building will open in Neuropia: [**The Tavern**](../learn/game-basics/neuropia/tavern.md). Here is where players can buy and sell their MINDS and Researcher NFTs.
