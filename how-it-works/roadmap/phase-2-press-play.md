# Phase 2 - Press Play

This marks the beginning of the **MIND Games Universe** gaming experience. The [**Arena** ](../../learn/game-basics/arena/)first opens its gates to the public. Alongside this, a new building will open in Neuropia: [**The Tavern**](../../learn/game-basics/neuropia/tavern.md). Here is where players can buy and sell their MINDS and Researcher NFTs.

Research log. Entry 1024: The MINDS declared us Negligible-Future-Threats. We have attended some fights in the ARENA and learned more of their rules. Some of the Researchers became actively involved, becoming coaches to MINDS.
