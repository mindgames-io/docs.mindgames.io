### Overview:&#x20;

* A form of yield farming

Commemorating the last MIND who knew the secrets of creating more [<mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md), Piero‚Äôs statue is a beloved reminder of MIND History. Another reason everybody is fond of it is its uncommon ability to bring back more [<mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> for token offerings left with it. In itself, Piero‚Äôs statue is a form of staking LP tokens and receiving [<mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> tokens. Most people think that this is just a statue of the famous alchemist Piero Da Vinci, the the last crafter of [<mark style="color:yellow;">**BRAIN CELL**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md). This, however, is not the whole truth. Piero, gathering some raw material from Monroe Maw, managed trap himself in stone. Alas, the stone was not dead but forever imbued with the spirit of Piero himself. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Piero now provides an avenue for liquidity providers to receive [<mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> tokens. You will receive [<mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) to use in the MIND Games for certain important items, skills, and talents!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In MIND Games, our very own Piero is our portrayal of yield farming. He receives individual **‚ÄùOfferings‚Äù** which can profit from grants by anyone who joins forces with him. Each **‚ÄúOffering‚Äù** (LP Pair) will give you details on the total share you receive from this grant. Piero studies each offering intensely and you can see this as a timer on each pair. Once he finishes his study, he awards you with your part of the yield representing your share of [<mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> tokens.&#x20;

Sensors and Melders will be able to help ‚ÄùPIERO‚Äù and earn [<mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> based in part on your total stake in a certain **‚ÄúOfferings‚Äù**.

## **Issuance Schedule**&#x20;

The issuance of <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> as a reward for staking <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL-LP**</mark> tokens as offerings with Piero‚Äôs Statue will change for each Epoch. \
\
**The Epoch** is 604,800 blocks on the **Aurora Network** and the length depends on the average block speed. \
\
**Epochs** were calculated to 604,800 blocks so that each **Epoch** would equal one week assuming a 1 second per block on the **Aurora Network.** If block speeds are longer or faster than 1 second per block on average, then an **Epoch** will last more or less than one week.

****

**Epoch 1:** 32x multiplier = 32 CELL/block = 1920 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 2:** 28x multiplier = 28 CELL/block = 1680 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 3:** 26x multiplier = 26 CELL/block = 1560 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 4:** 24x multiplier = 24 CELL/block = 1440 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 5:** 22x multiplier = 22 CELL/block = 1320 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 6:** 20x multiplier = 20 CELL/block = 1200 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 7:** 18x multiplier = 18 CELL/block = 1080 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 8:** 16x multiplier = 16 CELL/block = 960 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 9:** 14x multiplier = 14 CELL/block = 840 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 10:** 12x multiplier = 12 CELL/block = 720 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 11:** 10x multiplier = 10 CELL/block = 600 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 12:** 9x multiplier = 9 CELL/block = 540 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 13:** 8x multiplier = 8 CELL/block = 480 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 14:** 7x multiplier = 7 CELL/block = 420 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 15:** 6x multiplier = 6 CELL/block = 360 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 16:** 5x multiplier = 5 CELL/block = 300 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 17-35:** 4x multiplier = 4 CELL/block = 240 CELL/minute&#x20;

**Epoch 36+:** 2x multiplier = 2 CELL/block = 120 CELL/minute

### Locking

Piero‚Äôs Statue grants locked <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> based on a timeline that begins once the LP is deposited.

The <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> tokens will unlock over a period of time. The process divides into epochs that are around a week long. The first Epoch (Week) will give you the 5% threshold unlocked tokens from the total <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> received. Starting with the second Epoch onward, every Epoch (Week) will provide an additional 2% on top.

**For example:** \
1st Epoch (Week) - 5% unlocked and 95% locked \
2nd Epoch (Week) - 7% unlocked and 93% locked \
3rd Epoch (Week) - 9% unlocked and 91% locked \
4th Epoch (Week) - 11% unlocked and 89% locked

The total number of Epochs is 51. The last Epoch will provide 100% unlocked <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> from the entire <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> received as a liquidity provider.

{% hint style="info" %}
Claimed locked <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> will remain **locked until block \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_** which marks the end of Epoch 51. \
Locked rewards will start unlocking via the vesting schedule for the following 52 Epochs..
{% endhint %}

**Piero Statue** will inform users regarding the amount of <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> received in **** total, how much is available for unlocking at that moment, and how much is locked at that time. \
\
Users can choose to unlock the total <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> received at a particular time, before the 51st Epoch, however, they will only obtain the unlocked portion of it. The rest will be locked in the deep magma layers of Monro Maw, from where you will start to acquire them via the vesting schedule. \
\
This model helps us migrate from the simple DEX economics to the in-game economics combining the DeFi tools with gameplay and creating a synergy that will nourish them both. If the tokens were to unlock at any given time, this would incentivize the farm and dump mechanics. This way, we ensure that the long-term sustainability of the token will always be relevant for the ecosystem that we are taking part in.

### Locking Model - Early Unlocking with Researchers and MIND NFTs

We are implementing the ability for **Researchers** and **MINDS** to work together and unlock <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> tokens early with [**Cryptography Quests**](../learn/game-basics/neuropia/missions.md#cryptography). \
The researcher's Talents and MINDS stats will determine the amount of <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> unlocked after each quest.

### **Piero‚Äôs Statue Staking Deposit and Withdrawal Fees**

There are no deposit fees for staking LP tokens with **Piero‚Äôs Statue**. We are implementing withdrawal fees for withdrawing staked LP tokens to protect against flash loans and, pumps and dumps. \
Each withdrawal resets the fee timer. \
\
The withdrawal fees are listed below:

* **0.01%** fee if a user withdraws after **4 Epochs**
* **0.25%** fee if a user withdraws after **2 Epochs but before 4 Epochs**
* **0.5%** fee if a user withdraws after **5 days but before 2 Epochs**
* **1%** fee if a user withdraws under **5 days. \***
* **2%** fee if a user withdraws under **3 days. \***&#x20;
* **4%** fee if a user withdraws under **24 hours. \***&#x20;
* **8%** fee if a user withdraws under **1 hour. \***
* **25%** slashing fee if a user withdraws **during the same block.**

_\*Days/Hours listed assumes a 1 second per block speed during such period and will depend on Aurora Blockchain speed._
