# ðŸª™ Synaptyx Token

![](../.gitbook/assets/Synaptyx\_256.png)

**The main token** of the MIND Games Universe will be <mark style="color:yellow;">**Synaptyx \[STX]**</mark>. It was found by the first **MINDS** as a product of an ancient scientific process. It was said that in order to produce <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>, all fields of study, from mathematics to art and sport, were needed to successfully turn any mundane element into the precious <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>. The method has been long lost as winds kept chipping away the once tall mountains of **Neuropia**. \
\
The last MIND who knew how to craft <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark> was caught in the wrath of the Monroe Maw's lava, trapping inside it its last whispers. Since then, MINDS have dedicated their lives to trying again to uncover its mysteries. Wars have been wagered over it, MINDS lostâ€¦ Nowadays, the MINDS work relentlessly in the [**Research Facility**](research-facility.md) to try and multiply the existing <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players can swap <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark> on our [**Decentralized Exchange**](decentralized-exchange.md) for any other token on the market. Its in-game utility stems from upgrading the [**Talents** ](../learn/game-basics/nfts/your-researcher/talents/)of your [**Researcher**](../learn/game-basics/nfts/your-researcher/)**,** buying and upgrading NFTs, and **Brain Storming** - a form of unstable cloning. <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark> will also be used for staking, for creating Liquidity Pool tokens <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX-LP**</mark> which in turn will give access to [**Pieroâ€™s Statue**](pieros-statue.md) - a form of yield farming.
{% endhint %}

Every <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark> transaction will allocate the takings:&#x20;

* A part will be going to the Vault - the place where all game rewards are stored.
* A part will be granted to power the Research Facility - where players that hold <mark style="color:yellow;">**xSTX**</mark> increase their <mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark> holdings.
* The rest will be used to develop the MIND Games Universe further.
