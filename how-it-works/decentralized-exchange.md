# ðŸ”€ Decentralized Exchange

### Overview:&#x20;

At the heart of our whole economic process stands the **DEX**. DeFi instruments synergize with games and this results in two main benefits:

1. Simplified UX (User Experience). Implementing the DEX directly into gameplay brings an entertaining alternative to blockchain technology adoption.
2. Sustainability. These instruments operate with the in-game currencies ensuring long-term utility and growth avenues.

* **Swapping** will allow the trading of various tokens and in-game assets for other tokens.&#x20;
* **Staking** will give users permission over voting systems within the MIND Universe.
* **Liquidity Providing** will be there as long-term standing for the players.

0.3% of each trade will be redirected to **Treasury**

A **DEX** component improves and brings value to the game economy. The markets currently hold DEXs that are gamified or gamified DeFi instruments; however, there is not a game that fully incorporates DeFi.\
\
With this project, we propose delivering the MIND Games economy segment via Blockchain and DeFi instruments that help it give our users sovereignty over their in-game assets.
