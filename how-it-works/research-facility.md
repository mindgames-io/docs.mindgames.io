### Overview:&#x20;

* Stake <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> and receive <mark style="color:yellow;">**xCELL**</mark> token
* Claim Rewards

In the **Research Facility**, players can deposit <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> as a form of staking. The hard-working MINDS that dwell here will analyze these and experiment day and night to uncover all their mysteries. Once their research is complete, the players will receive <mark style="color:yellow;">**xCELL**</mark> as a reward for their interest in science. \
\
The <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> will be brought in from various fees of game transactions and withdrawal fees from the Mighty [**Piero's Statue**](pieros-statue.md). <mark style="color:yellow;">**xCELL**</mark> will therefore become the Governance token of the MIND Games Universe.

{% hint style="info" %}
A part of the fees collected from trading and withdrawals on each pool will be distributed to the Research Facility.
