### Overview:&#x20;

* Stake [<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX\]**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) and receive [<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[xCRX\]**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) token
* Claim Rewards

In the **Research Facility**, players can deposit [<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX\]**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) as a form of staking. The hard-working MINDS that dwell here will analyze these and experiment day and night to uncover all their mysteries. Once their research is complete, the players will receive [<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[xCRX\]**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) as a reward for their interest in science. \
\
The [<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX\]**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) will be brought in from various fees of game transactions, swaps, and withdrawal fees from the Mighty [**Piero's Statue**](pieros-statue.md). [<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[xCRX\]**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) will therefore become the Governance token of the **MIND Games Universe.**
