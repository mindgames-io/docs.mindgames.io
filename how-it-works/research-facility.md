### Overview:&#x20;

* Stake [<mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) and receive <mark style="color:yellow;">**x**</mark>[<mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) token
* Claim Rewards

In the **Research Facility**, players can deposit [<mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> as a form of staking. The hard-working MINDS that dwell here will analyze these and experiment day and night to uncover all their mysteries. Once their research is complete, the players will receive <mark style="color:yellow;">**x**</mark>[<mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> as a reward for their interest in science. \
\
The [<mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> will be brought in from various fees of game transactions and withdrawal fees from the Mighty [**Piero's Statue**](pieros-statue.md). <mark style="color:yellow;">**x**</mark>[<mark style="color:yellow;">**STX**</mark>](brain-cell-token.md) <mark style="color:yellow;">****</mark> will therefore become the Governance token of the MIND Games Universe.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Research Facility is set to receive fees from in-game transactions starting with Phases 2 and 3. Until then, 0.05% of fees are received from trading and \~ 0.25% from Piero's Statue fees, so that the APR will remain 25-30% for the time being.&#x20;
