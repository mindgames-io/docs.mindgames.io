# ‚è≥ Launchpad

The MIND Games launchpad is a platform that enables new projects to launch on the Arbitrum network using a fair launch model. The platform provides a transparent and secure environment for launching new projects.&#x20;

To help you understand the mechanics of the Fair Launch model, we have provided an example using MIND Games. This will give you a better idea of how the Fair Launch model works and how it can benefit new projects launching on our platform. ****&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**The mechanism described below is provided for exemplary purposes, to give you an idea of how our platform operates.**

MIND Games was created as a protocol that relies on community participation, and the launch of the <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cortex \[CRX]**</mark> token is a crucial step in achieving this goal. Our team's priority has been to create the best possible product without seeking funding, and we're pleased to confirm that we have not conducted any presale or received any VC investment. Therefore, the public sale offers an entirely transparent and equitable chance for the community, investors, and partners to buy <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX]**</mark>.&#x20;

* Public Sale: 18.18% of the Cortex supply, with 9.9% in <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cortex \[CRX]**</mark> to claim in 24h after the sale ends and 9.9% vested for 3 months with a monthly release.&#x20;
* All purchases will settle at the same price based on the total amount deposited
* Any unsold tokens will be burned&#x20;

During the public sale, **18.18%** of the total supply of <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cortex \[CRX]**</mark> tokens (equivalent to **2,000,000 **<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX]**</mark> tokens out of the **10,000,000** <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX]**</mark> total supply) will be made available for purchase.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Participants in the sale will have the opportunity to claim **50%** of their purchase in <mark style="color:yellow;">**Cortex \[CRX]**</mark> tokens within 24 hours after the sale ends, while the remaining **50%** will be vested for 3 months with a monthly release. All buyers will settle at the same price based on the total amount deposited, ensuring a fair and consistent purchase experience. Additionally, any unsold tokens will be removed from circulation through a process of burning.
