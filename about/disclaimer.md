To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, in no event shall MIND Games, its employees, directors, shareholders, officers, consultants, representatives, agents, or contractors be liable or responsible for any direct, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental, or consequential damages or losses of any kind, nor shall they be liable for the loss of goodwill, loss of profits (including expected), loss of data, diminution of value, and business interruption arising out of or in connection with the Materials or reliance thereon, any inaccuracy or omission in any Materials, whether based upon breach of warranty or contract, negligence, strict liability, tort, or any other legal theory, regardless of whether we have been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses.

### **The MIND Games platform and protocol are in their Beta Stage**

The MIND Games platform and protocol are in their beta stage, which means that the MIND Games platform and protocol and all related software are experimental. MIND Games platform and protocol are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the MIND Games platform and protocol are free of defects, vulnerabilities, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. No part of the Website, MIND Games platform and protocol or Materials should be considered a business, legal, financial, investment, tax advice, or advice of a broker regarding any matters to which all or any part of such information relates. You should consult your own legal, financial, tax, or other professional advisors regarding any such information.

### **Acceptance of Risks and No Liability**

You must read the statements below, and by accessing or using the MIND Games platform and protocol, you accept all of the listed risks and agree that we shall not be in any way liable for any losses or damages incurred due to or in connection with such risks.

## **Risks Disclosure Statement**

### **Acceptance of Risks and No Liability**

You must read the Risks Disclosure Statement below, and by accessing or using the MIND Games platform and protocol, you accept all of the listed risks and agree that we shall not be in any way liable for any losses or damages incurred due to or in connection with such risks.

### **Risk of Software Weaknesses**

Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that the MIND Games platform and protocol and related software follow the high-security standards, we do not warrant or represent that the MIND Games platform and protocol are secure or safe or protected from fishing, malware, or other malicious attacks.

### **Risk Inherent in the Blockchain**

The MIND Games platform and protocol are or will be deployed on the Aurora Network, and later they may be deployed on other blockchains. As a result, any malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of such blockchain(s) may have a material adverse effect on the MIND Games platform and protocol. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the MIND Games platform and protocol and related blockchain software by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the blockchain. The smart-contract concept, the underlying software application, and the software platform (i.e., AURORA, NEAR, or other blockchains) are still in an early development stage and unproven. Although it is very unlikely, the blockchain and any other blockchain can be attacked, which may result in downtime, consensus split, long reorganization of the chain, 51 percent attack, or other adverse outcomes, each of which may lead to complete loss of your digital assets.

### **Risk of Flawed Logic of MIND Games platform and protocol**

The underlying logic of the MIND Games platform, MIND Games protocol, and related software may be flawed, defective, or impaired, which can result in smart-contracts operating incorrectly or not as expected, or transactions being executed in violation of the logic which underpins the smart-contracts, which can lead to partial or complete loss of digital assets used in the transaction.

### **Risk of Confusing User Interface**

We do our best to ensure the UI/UX is done to the highest quality standard in this industry. If you are not certain regarding the use, functionality, and implications of any of our user interface elements (buttons, tick boxes, range selectors, etc.), please ask a trusted official of the MIND Games team before using that functionality or feature. Do Your Own Research before clicking any button, before making any decision on the MIND Games platform and protocol.

### **Risk of Legal Uncertainty**

The intended activities of MIND Games are subject to various laws and regulations in the countries where it operates or intends to operate. We might be obliged to obtain different licenses or other permissive documents in some or all jurisdictions where we intend to operate our business. Therefore, our business in such jurisdictions shall always be subject to obtaining such licenses or permissive documents directed by applicable laws. There is a risk that certain activities may be deemed in violation of any such law or regulation. Penalties for any such potential violation would be unknown. Additionally, changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations of existing law could, in certain circumstances, result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures, which could affect our ability to carry on the business model and develop the MIND Games platform and protocol.

### **Risk of Theft**

We make a commercially reasonable effort to ensure that any transactions carried out via or on the MIND Games platform and protocol are secure. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the digital assets as a result of hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, double-spent attacks, flash-loan attacks, vulnerabilities or defects of the MIND Games platform, and protocol, or related software, of the Arbitrum Network or any other blockchain, or otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. Any of the above may lead to partial or complete theft or loss of digital assets used in transactions carried out on the MIND Games platform.
