# Step 1 - Ethereum

**Be sure you have Ethereum in your** [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/) **wallet. If you already have Ethereum, please jump to the next guide:** [**How to transfer your assets to the Aurora network.**](step-2-near-wallet.md)****

**If you don’t have Ethereum in your wallet, please follow the guidelines from the beginning.**

## Get Ethereum

**You need to help yourself with some Ethereum. In our example, we are going to use Binance. Please create an account if you don’t already have one at** [**www.binance.com**](http://www.binance.com)**.**

**After creating the account, access the following link and press on Buy ETH here:** [**https://www.binance.com/en/buy-ethereum**](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-ethereum)****
