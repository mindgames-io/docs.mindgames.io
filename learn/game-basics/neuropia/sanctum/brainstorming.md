If you see two MINDS heading to the Sanctum...it's safe to say, there will be more than a spark between them!

<mark style="color:blue;">**Brain Storming**</mark>, the process of MIND multiplication on STEM 2801. The exact processes and transformations that go on are still unknown to our Researchers, however, they are crafting various hypotheses. So far they have observed the following:

<mark style="color:blue;">**Brain Storming**</mark> requires two MINDS, which we will refer to as the Original ones. When the Originals Brain Storm, then the new MIND created has a chance to be of a higher rarity than they were. What makes any MIND unique is its traits: rarity, class, set and abilities (spells, IQ and SRT). Think of these as the MIND's status, personality, occupation, genetic predispositions, strengths and weaknesses.

Based on the above table you can guide your Brain Storming process. The 2 original MINDS can have one of two roles. These will determine different aspects of the future MIND's traits. Once the Brain Storming process is complete, the two Originals, need time to rest. If they are Elders the resting period will be 24 hours. If they are subsequent generations, the resting time will increase.



**Gene Multiplication**

As far as the MINDS Genetic makeup is concerned, a few things differ from our own.&#x20;

Elder MINDS are the ones **** that have given birth to the entire race. They are to be protected at all costs.

Combine any 2 Rarities and get a chance to get a higher rarity card.



**Inheritance**

MINDS have very special traits and abilities. Some of these they get from their Originals and some of them are received through their Class or Rarity.

10% Chance to get a higher rarity&#x20;

30% Rarity of the highest card&#x20;

55% Rarity of the lower card&#x20;

5% Lower rarity



If the New MIND is the same Rarity or lower than the Originals lowest Rarity

10% chance of +5 Main Stat

20% chance of -5 Main Stat

70% no change



If the New MIND is the same Rarity or higher than the Originals highest Rarity

10% chance of +10 Main Stat

30% chance of +5 Main Stat

60% no increase



**Transference**

The newly created MIND will belong to the Set:

40% chance of Cloner

45% of Clonee

5% Wild

10% Mutate to other Set



**Wind down**

After a long process in which the two MINDS put their heads together to bring a new one into existence, they need to rest. to rest.

Gen 0 MINDS Will have a 24h Wind Down Period ( based on block ) and subsequent Generations will have a higher rate.

_Wind Down = 24h+(24h\*Gen)_
