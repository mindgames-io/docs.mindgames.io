If you see two MINDS heading to the Sanctum...it's safe to say, there will be more than a spark between them!

<mark style="color:blue;">**Brain Storming**</mark>, the process of MIND multiplication on STEM 2801. The exact processes and transformations that go on are still unknown to our Researchers, however, they are crafting various hypotheses. So far they have observed the following:

<mark style="color:blue;">**Brain Storming**</mark> requires two MINDS, which we will refer to as the Original ones. When the Originals Brain Storm, then the new MIND created has a chance to be of a higher rarity than they were. What makes any MIND unique is its traits: rarity, class, set and abilities (spells, IQ and SRT). Think of these as the MIND's status, personality, occupation, genetic predispositions, strengths and weaknesses.

Based on the above table you can guide your Brain Storming process. The 2 original MINDS can have one of two roles. These will determine different aspects of the future MIND's traits. Once the Brain Storming process is complete, the two Originals, need time to rest. If they are Elders the resting period will be 24 hours. If they are subsequent generations, the resting time will increase.
