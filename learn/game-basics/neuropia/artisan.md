## Overview:&#x20;

* Craft new items from in-game resources

Looking for a lingot, some building materials, some Kale fat? Chances are, the Artisans can craft it for you. All you need to do is bring them the required ingredients and if they know the recipe they’ll make it in no time!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Players can transform their current resources into new ones to access more features of the MIND Games Universe. Once crafted, the new item cannot be taken apart back into its original ingredients.
