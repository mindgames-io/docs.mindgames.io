Psst! Researcher! Let me know if you need to transfer your locked CELL. I know everyone around here. I can help you transfer it safely to another Researcher. It has to be all moved at once though, I have a quite long queue of clients, you know?

{% hint style="warning" %}
The entire amount of **wallet and locked CELL** will be moved in the transfer. Make sure to **claim all rewards** before proceeding, **unclaimed rewards will not be transferred**.

&#x20;If you wish to keep your unlocked CELL on this Researcherâ€™s account, please store it in the Research Facility.&#x20;

**xCELL is not transferred by this service.** In order to transfer xCELL, it needs to be manually sent to the new wallet. Transferring the locked CELL to the same address will bring Gnomonâ€™s wrath upon it and **destroy it forever.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:**&#x20;

**This process is irreversible.**&#x20;

You will not be able to cancel or undo this transfer. Please **make sure that you entered the correct wallet address** and that it is **NOT the same** wallet that contains the locked CELL you are attempting to transfer.
{% endhint %}
