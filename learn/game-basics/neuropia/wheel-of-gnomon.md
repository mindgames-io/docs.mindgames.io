# ðŸŽ¡ Wheel of Gnomon

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Gnomon.png)

The MINDS often find comfort spinning the wheel of Gnomon. Holding a small deposit of <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>, the MINDS spin this wheel to get omens of their day. Having no scientific reasoning, it proves as a useful whimsical tool to help MINDS feel more spirituality. Life without uncertainty would be like a MIND dinner without Kale.
