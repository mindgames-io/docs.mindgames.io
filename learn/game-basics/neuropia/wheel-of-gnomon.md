# ðŸŽ¡ Wheel of Gnomon

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Wheel_ScreenS.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The MINDS often find comfort in spinning the wheel of Gnomon. Holding a small deposit of [<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX\]**</mark>](../../../how-it-works/brain-cell-token.md) , the MINDS spin this wheel to get omens of their day. Having no scientific reasoning, it proves as a useful whimsical tool to help MINDS feel more spiritual. Life without uncertainty would be like a MIND dinner without Kale.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players can use this mini-game to place an amount of [<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX\]**</mark>](../../../how-it-works/brain-cell-token.md) and spin the wheel to double it or even receive a monumental x10, or Gnomon will omnomnom it. The wheel can be spun an unlimited amount of times per day.

{% hint style="info" %}
[<mark style="color:yellow;">**\[CRX\]**</mark>](../../../how-it-works/brain-cell-token.md) collected by the **Wheel of Gnomon** will be redistributed to the W.o.G. reward pool, Vault, Research Facility, and Burn.&#x20;

## The Ticket System&#x20;

Each offering to Gnomon, or spin of the Wheel is done by using the ancient ticketing system. Depending on the size of your problem, for instance, for a circumvolution fungus, you might want a <mark style="color:green;">**\[Common Ticket]**</mark>, or if you want to rule the world and overthrow the Monarchy, you might want a <mark style="color:purple;">**\[Legendary Ticket]**</mark> and for anything in between, well, the <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[Rare Ticket]**</mark>.

The rewards Gnomon offers for spinning his wheel also differ in size and proportion to the Ticket you use.&#x20;
