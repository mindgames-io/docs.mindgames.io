The MINDS often find comfort spinning the wheel of Gnomon. Holding a small deposit of <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark>, the MINDS spin this wheel to get omens of their day. Having no scientific reasoning, it proves as a useful whimsical tool to help MINDS feel more spirituality. Life without uncertainty would be like a MIND dinner without Kale.

{% hint style="info" %}
Players can use this mini-game to place an amount of <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> and spin the wheel to double it or even receive a monumental x10, or Gnomon will omnomnom it. The wheel can be spun an unlimited amount of times per day.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> collected by the **Wheel of Gnomon** will be redistributed to the W.o.G. reward pool, Vault, Research Facility, and Burn.&#x20;

\
**â€‹Disclaimer:** Due to the great care a game economy requires, the specific numbers regarding the redistribution of <mark style="color:yellow;">**CELL**</mark> may be susceptible to change.&#x20;

## The Ticket System&#x20;

Each offering to Gnomon, or spin of the Wheel is done by using the ancient ticketing system. Depending on the size of your problem, for instance, for a circumvolution fungus, you might want a <mark style="color:green;">**\[Common Ticket]**</mark>, or if you want to rule the world and overthrow the Monarchy, you might want a <mark style="color:purple;">**\[Legendary Ticket]**</mark> and for anything in between, well, the <mark style="color:yellow;">**\[Rare Ticket]**</mark>.

The rewards Gnomon offers for spinning his wheel also differ in size and proportion to the Ticket you use.&#x20;
