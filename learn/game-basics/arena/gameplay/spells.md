# Spells

All cards have **** 3 spells: **1 Attack**, **1 Defence** and **1 Passive**. The position on which you place the card will determine which spell is played by that card: attack or defence. The passive is applied to both cards on your side of the board. The 2 cards played on the board are called the Nucleus. The rest of the cards kept in hand + the Nucleus are called the Circuit.
