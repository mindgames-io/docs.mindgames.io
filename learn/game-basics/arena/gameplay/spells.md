# Spells

All cards have 3 spells: **1 Attack**, **1 Defence** and **1 Passive**. The position on which you place the card will determine which spell is played by that card: attack or defense. The passive is applied to both cards on your side of the board. The 2 cards played on the board are called the Nucleus. The rest of the cards kept in hand + the Nucleus are called the Circuit.

{% hint style="danger" %}
When one player has only **ONE MIND** left standing on the board, it will **ENRAGE**. Enrage will give that MIND an **Extra Attack** using it's **MAIN STAT** to both enemy positions besides it's normal spells. In return it will receive **DOUBLE DAMAGE** to it's ID!
