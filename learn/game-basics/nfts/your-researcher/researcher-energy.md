# Researcher Energy

A researcher has 15 Energy every 8 hours, meaning that you can perform 15 Commands per 8 hours. You can increase the number of commands later by using[<img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Potion Of Swiftmind.png" alt="" data-size="line"><mark style="color:orange;">**Potion of Swiftmind**</mark>](../../currency.md#potion-of-swiftmind) or other revitalizing agents.

Researchers spend Energy to participate in any game mode.
