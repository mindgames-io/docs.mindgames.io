# IQ and SRT

### IQ:&#x20;

The life essence of the MINDS is IQ. This determines a MIND's place in society and its level of skill. Not all cards have the same IQ levels. For example, if all MINDS have over 200IQ, Larry is more of a 142.

A card's Rarity influences the average IQ a card has and the other statistics. IQ is invaluable to all our NFTs since it will determine a player's victory or loss.

### SRT:&#x20;

Just like that perfect comeback: witty, bold, humorous, final; the one that comes to you 20 minutes after the argument endedâ€¦ It is not enough in this Universe to be clever, one must also be quick!

{% hint style="info" %}
**SRT** (Synapse Response Time) DeFines a MIND's reaction time, thus getting the upper hand in combat situations. A lower SRT value means increased speed, so an NFT with 0.6 SRT will act faster than an NFT with an SRT value of 1.
