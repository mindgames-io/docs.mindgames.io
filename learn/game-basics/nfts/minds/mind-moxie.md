# Mind Moxie

Your MINDS are very singular creatures. They can hyperfocus on one thing but they seem to be locked on that for a long period of time. No matter how much we tried, it seems you can't change a MINDS mind.

MINDS have a daring and ambitious side. They stop at nothing when they feel the call of their will and all better step out of their way. However, like any forceful hero, they need their rest as well. They get 100% involved when they start anything: a match, a shift, an adventure.
