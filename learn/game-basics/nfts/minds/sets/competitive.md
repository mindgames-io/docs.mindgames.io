# Competitive

The best of the best? It has to be these MINDS. Ambitious and determined, they will never take 2nd for an answer! Their place is at the top, and they look great in gold. Hard workers and true fighters, there's no obstacle they cannot overcome, no challenge they cannot conquer. After all, most of their muscles were built carrying cups and trophies.
