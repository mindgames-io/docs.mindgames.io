# Cryptonauts

It's quiet here. The few MINDS who dared wander around here know of the beauty that's hard to compare. Their wish is to end up among the stars. From there, all MIND troubles seem so small. Time moves at a different pace. It's a slower, colder time, even though closer to the Sun. \*gasp\* Space Schnapps! One small thought for a MIND, one huge belly-warmer for MASA.
