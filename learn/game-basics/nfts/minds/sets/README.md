**Findings log. Entry 120:**

So far, we know their society functions based on classes, on rarities. They seem to have certain social groups and tend to remain in close proximity to them. Some are very active and dynamic; others tend to dwell in crafts or art. There seem to be ten different communities. The largest one we found contains ten unique individuals, however, there may be multiple copies of every MIND. We assume most communities have around ten unique types, yet we could only find some of them. The team is keeping an eye out. Wait a minute, I didn't see that before... What even is that thing??
