# New Horizons

How do clouds taste, and where does the Sun go when it's evening? Curiosity and great ideas go hand in hand for them. These are the MINDS that create the impossible and make all others wonder, "Who could have ever imagined?". With gears and sketches, sails and wings, these are the MINDS to bring dreams closer to reality. \*finds sketch on the floor\* Ouch! That's a sharp one.
