# Wild Jokesters

Clever, adventurous, heroic, mythical, sensitive, cosmic, powerful, merciless, innovative, and spectral, the Jokesters are born chameleons ready to take on any role given. They can successfully imitate any other MIND and are rumored to be rather sneaky. Three snuck into the wax museum last year, that was not a fun night shift for Larry.
