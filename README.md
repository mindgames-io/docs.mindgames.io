Players are represented by Researcher cards that can be customized based on their playing style and interests, and all Talent points acquired can be traded on the Marketplace.

To ensure a safe and sustainable player experience, MIND Games has a limited daily energy system, and rewards players for their efforts with resources, items, and other bonuses. The Decentralized Exchange platform within the Marketplace allows players to swap tokens and participate in the Piero’s Statue offering. Additionally, the Research Facility offers staking opportunities for players to deposit tokens and receive rewards for their contributions to the scientific community.

Overall, MIND Games offers a dynamic and engaging experience for players looking to immerse themselves in a unique and thriving game universe.
